get.wod98.ssps -   amazing program                                  A. Ganse, APL-UW, 9/2001

Description:
---------------------------
This script and the two programs that come with it read and filter data from
the World Ocean Database 1998 (ie "WOD98", a NOAA/NODC dataset from the Ocean
Climate Laboratory or "OCL" - for more information and access to their online
data see http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5).

In an attempt to compress the large amount of data in WOD98, OCL put the data
into a curious (and frankly not very efficient either) data format, hence the
need for a reader routine.  The reader routine includes a number of basic
filtering capabilities to select out data profiles for given locations, dates,
and so on.  It also tries to be at least somewhat efficient in its filtering
and searching methods to reduce access time.  Also, if it ever becomes 
necessary, note that the reader program was written in a modular way with
functions that were meant to allow embedding into other C programs.

The two accompanying programs, oclfilt and sspcomp, were designed to be used
together (in particular, sspcomp is meant to work on oclfilt's output).
Oclfilt reads and filters OCL's WOD98 data, outputting depth/temp/salinity/etc
profiles with extra cruise information.  Sspcomp takes oclfilt's output (or
some other input designed to mimic oclfilt's output format) and uses the 
Chen-Millero-Li ocean soundspeed model to convert the depth/temp/salinity
profiles to depth/soundspeed profiles.  The programs each have manpages and
readme files of their own in their respective src directories, and can be used
in broader circumstances than just that seen in the get.wod98.ssps script
But this script covers the most common usage, and serves as an introduction
to how one might use oclfilt and sspcomp together elsewhere.

To get started, the user can just modify locations/dates/etc in get.wod98.ssps
and run it to obtain the needed data from WOD98 in ASCII columnar form.
Additional command line arguments are described in oclfilt's and sspcomp's
manpages, and for further questions and clarifications the user is welcome to
contact Andy Ganse (APL-UW) at aganse@apl.washington.edu.



Directions for use:
---------------------------
0.) This package is designed to be run on a UNIX system that has a C compiler,
the "make" utility, and the C Shell (csh) installed.  The C code for the
actual reading/calculating programs is all in ANSI C, however, and uses no
additional libraries, so I think there would be little trouble compiling it
on another platform (eg MSWindows)... but I haven't tried or tested this.

1.) Once you've untarred this package you will need to run "make" to compile
the oclfilt and sspcomp programs that the get.wod98.ssps script uses.
Just type:
   make
and wait a few minutes for the programs to compile.

2.) In the same directory with get.wod98.ssps in it, try a command line like
the following to make sure everything works (with the WOD98 standard-levels
CD in the drive):
   get.wod98.ssps | more
You may need to check that the path to the CD drive used in the script matches
your system.  You should see output looking something like the below.  Note
the % symbol that begins every comment line, as a key for skipping that line.

%  Lat      Lon   Year Mo Dy  Time   Depth    Temp      Saln  Calcd_SSP
%  deg      deg   yyyy mm dd   hrs  meters    deg C      ppt     m/s
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
%Station #82, bottom depth   57.00 m (from h),  standard level data
35.0100 122.2333 1983 11 19 11.10    0.000   15.993   32.111  1506.424
35.0100 122.2333 1983 11 19 11.10   10.000   16.005   32.103  1506.616
35.0100 122.2333 1983 11 19 11.10   20.000   16.027   32.107  1506.854
35.0100 122.2333 1983 11 19 11.10   30.000   15.947   32.111  1506.774
35.0100 122.2333 1983 11 19 11.10   50.000   12.426   32.574  1496.194
etc...

3.) Once you've verified this works, you'll of course you'll want to modify
the script parameters (region, depths, etc) to return the data you're
interested in.

4.) The get.wod98.ssps script as it comes with this package assumes that its
own directory will be the current working directory when being run, and that
the oclfilt and sspcomp executables will be in that directory (as put there
automatically by "make").  You should at least try this configuration once
after "making" to be sure everything works this far, but you are not stuck
with this setup.
If you want to use the get.wod98.ssps script more generally, you can:
 a.) copy the oclfilt and sspcomp executables to your ~/bin directory,
 b.) verify that your ~/bin directory is in your path,
 c.) run the "rehash" command so the system knows you just added a new
     executable to your path since logging in,
 d.) and finally modify the "./oclfilt" and "./sspcomp" entries in
     get.wod98.ssps to "oclfilt" and "sspcomp" since they will no longer
     be in the current directory.

5.) For modifying the resulting output into a form suitable for various
further scripts, the AWK command/language has been very helpful in skipping
comment lines, swapping columns, and so on.  Other tools might work just as
well, but an AWK example for this is included (convert.awk).  Try:
   get.wod98.ssps | awk -f convert.awk | more


Hopefully, since the majority of data requests have fit the format of what
get.wod98.ssps returns, this will be enough to get you the data you need.
But if not I'm certainly happy to answer questions and lend a hand to the
extent that I can spare the time for it...

Cheers,
